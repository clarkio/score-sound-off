# score-sound-off

An Angular/Node.js project for providing latest game scores and audible announcements of scoring events.

>Generated from HotTowel Angular

TODO:
* Highlight game that just had a score change
* Make it easier to modify/generate the test data
* Write some unit tests yo! so you don't have to manually test anymore

>*Opinionated Angular style guide for teams by [@john_papa](//twitter.com/john_papa)*

>More details about the styles and patterns used in this app can be found in my [Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide) and my [Angular Patterns: Clean Code](http://jpapa.me/ngclean) course at [Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/john-papa) and working in teams.

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
 - on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
 - on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

3. Install these NPM packages globally

    ```bash
    npm install -g bower gulp nodemon
    ```

    >Refer to these [instructions on how to not require sudo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md)

## Running Score Sound Off

### Linting
 - Run code analysis using `gulp vet`. This runs jshint, jscs, and plato.

### Tests
 - Run the unit tests using `gulp test` (via karma, mocha, sinon).

### Running in dev mode
 - Choose whether you want to use the test data or live data (this is off by default right now)
    - To toggle whether test or live data is used edit variable `useTestData` in the file `src/server/scores-service.js` on line 29.
    > When using live data you should be aware of the interval at which you're pulling that data from the source. By default the data will be requested every 30 seconds.
 - Run the project with `gulp serve-dev`

 - This opens the web app in a browser and updates the browser with any files changes.

### Building the project
 - Build the optimized project using `gulp build`
 - This create the optimized code for the project and puts it in the build folder

### Running the optimized code
 - Run the optimize project from the build folder with `gulp serve-build`

### Modifying Data Retrieval Interval
 - Open `src/server/app.js` and change the value of `intervalInSeconds` on line 35.
 > When using live data you should be aware of the interval at which you're pulling that data from the source. By default the data will be requested every 30 seconds.
 
### Modifying Test Data
 - Open `src/server/test-helpers/test-data-bottomline.json` and you'll see an `nfl` property with a long string as its value.
    - In the string you should see all mock NFL games for one week in a url-encoded format. This is the format used in the source system that the data is retrieved from.
 - Find a game you want to change in the url-encoded string.
 - Change a team's score by modifying the value between the `%20` just after the team's name.

## Gulp Tasks

### Task Listing

- `gulp help`

    Displays all of the available gulp tasks.

### Code Analysis

- `gulp vet`

    Performs static code analysis on all javascript files. Runs jshint and jscs.

- `gulp vet --verbose`

    Displays all files affected and extended information about the code analysis.

- `gulp plato`

    Performs code analysis using plato on all javascript files. Plato generates a report in the reports folder.

### Testing

- `gulp serve-specs`

    Serves and browses to the spec runner html page and runs the unit tests in it. Injects any changes on the fly and re runs the tests. Quick and easy view of tests as an alternative to terminal via `gulp test`.

- `gulp test`

    Runs all unit tests using karma runner, mocha, chai and sinon with phantomjs. Depends on vet task, for code analysis.

- `gulp test --startServers`

    Runs all unit tests and midway tests. Cranks up a second node process to run a server for the midway tests to hit a web api.

- `gulp autotest`

    Runs a watch to run all unit tests.

- `gulp autotest --startServers`

    Runs a watch to run all unit tests and midway tests. Cranks up a second node process to run a server for the midway tests to hit a web api.

### Cleaning Up

- `gulp clean`

    Remove all files from the build and temp folders

- `gulp clean-images`

    Remove all images from the build folder

- `gulp clean-code`

    Remove all javascript and html from the build folder

- `gulp clean-fonts`

    Remove all fonts from the build folder

- `gulp clean-styles`

    Remove all styles from the build folder

### Fonts and Images

- `gulp fonts`

    Copy all fonts from source to the build folder

- `gulp images`

    Copy all images from source to the build folder

### Styles

- `gulp styles`

    Compile less files to CSS, add vendor prefixes, and copy to the build folder

### Bower Files

- `gulp wiredep`

    Looks up all bower components' main files and JavaScript source code, then adds them to the `index.html`.

    The `.bowerrc` file also runs this as a postinstall task whenever `bower install` is run.

### Angular HTML Templates

- `gulp templatecache`

    Create an Angular module that adds all HTML templates to Angular's $templateCache. This pre-fetches all HTML templates saving XHR calls for the HTML.

- `gulp templatecache --verbose`

    Displays all files affected by the task.

### Serving Development Code

- `gulp serve-dev`

    Serves the development code and launches it in a browser. The goal of building for development is to do it as fast as possible, to keep development moving efficiently. This task serves all code from the source folders and compiles less to css in a temp folder.

- `gulp serve-dev --nosync`

    Serves the development code without launching the browser.

- `gulp serve-dev --debug`

    Launch debugger with node-inspector.

- `gulp serve-dev --debug-brk`

    Launch debugger and break on 1st line with node-inspector.

### Building Production Code

- `gulp optimize`

    Optimize all javascript and styles, move to a build folder, and inject them into the new index.html

- `gulp build`

    Copies all fonts, copies images and runs `gulp optimize` to build the production code to the build folder.

### Serving Production Code

- `gulp serve-build`

    Serve the optimized code from the build folder and launch it in a browser.

- `gulp serve-build --nosync`

    Serve the optimized code from the build folder and manually launch the browser.

- `gulp serve-build --debug`

    Launch debugger with node-inspector.

- `gulp serve-build --debug-brk`

    Launch debugger and break on 1st line with node-inspector.

### Bumping Versions

- `gulp bump`

    Bump the minor version using semver.
    --type=patch // default
    --type=minor
    --type=major
    --type=pre
    --ver=1.2.3 // specific version
